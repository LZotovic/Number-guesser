# Number-guesser

The Number Guesser program is an interactive console application in C++ that challenges users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. Upon starting the program, users are prompted to choose a range: either 1 to 10, 1 to 100, or 1 to 1000.

After selecting the range, the program generates a random number within that range and allows the user to specify how many attempts they would like to have to guess the number. The user then inputs their guesses one by one. For each guess, the program provides feedback, indicating whether the guess is correct or not, and how many tries are left.

If the user successfully guesses the number within the allowed attempts, the program congratulates them; otherwise, it reveals the correct number after the attempts are exhausted.
